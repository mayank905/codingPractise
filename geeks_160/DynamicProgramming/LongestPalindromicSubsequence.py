'''
Given a string s, return the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

A palindromic sequence is a sequence that reads the same forward and backward.

Examples:

Input: s = "bbabcbcab"
Output: 7
Explanation: Subsequence "babcbab" is the longest subsequence which is also a palindrome.
Input: s = "abcd"
Output: 1
Explanation: "a", "b", "c" and "d" are palindromic and all have a length 1.
Input: s = "agbdba"
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest palindromic subsequence is "abdba", which has a length of 5. The characters in this subsequence are taken from the original string "agbdba", and they maintain the order of the string while forming a palindrome.
Constraints:
1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 1000
The string contains only lowercase letters.

class Solution:

    def longestPalinSubseq(self, s):
        # code here
        s2=s[::-1]
        len1=len(s)
        len2=len1
        dp=[[0 for _ in range(len2+1)] for _ in range(len1+1)]
        
        for i in range(1, len1+1):
            for j in range(1, len2+1):
                if s[i-1]==s2[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j]=dp[i-1][j-1]+1
                else:
                    dp[i][j]=max(dp[i-1][j],dp[i][j-1])
        return dp[len1][len2]
