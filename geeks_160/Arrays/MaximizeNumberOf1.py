'''
Given a binary array arr[] (containing only 0s and 1s) and an integer k, you are allowed to flip at most k 0s to 1s. Find the maximum number of consecutive 1's that can be obtained in the array after performing the operation at most k times.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 1], k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: Maximum subarray of consecutive 1's is of size 3 which can be obtained after flipping the zero present at the 1st index.
Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: By flipping the zeroes at indices 4 and 6, we get the longest subarray from index 3 to 7 containing all 1â€™s.
Input: arr[] = [1, 1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Since the array is already having the max consecutive 1's, hence we dont need to perform any operation. Hence the answer is 2
Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 105
0 <= k <= arr.size()
0 <= arr[i] <= 1
