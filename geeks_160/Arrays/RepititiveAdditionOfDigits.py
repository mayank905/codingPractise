'''
You are given a positive integer n, you need to add all the digits of n and create a new number. Perform this operation until the resultant number has only one digit in it. Return the final number obtained after performing the given operation.

Examples:

Input: n = 1234
Output: 1
Explanation: Step 1: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. Step 2: 1 + 0 = 1
Input: n = 5674
Output: 4
Explanation: Step 1: 5 + 6 + 7 + 4 = 22. Step 2: 2 + 2 = 4
Input: n = 9
Output: 9
Explanation: Since 9 is a single-digit number hence we return 9.
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 109

        while n>=10:
            cur=0
            while n:
                cur+=n%10
                n=n//10
            n=cur
        return n
