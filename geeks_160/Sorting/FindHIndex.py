'''
Given an integer array citations[], where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for the ith paper. The task is to find the H-index.

H-Index is the largest value such that the researcher has at least H papers that have been cited at least H times.

Examples:

Input: citations[] = [3, 0, 5, 3, 0]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are at least 3 papers (3, 5, 3) with at least 3 citations.
Input: citations[] = [5, 1, 2, 4, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 3 papers (with citation counts of 5, 2, and 4) that have 2 or more citations. However, the H-Index cannot be 3 because there aren't 3 papers with 3 or more citations.
Input: citations[] = [0, 0]
Output: 0
Constraints:
1 ≤ citations.size() ≤ 106
0 ≤ citations[i] ≤ 106

            count+=1
            if cit<count:
                return maxH
            else:
                maxH=max(maxH,count)
        return maxH
